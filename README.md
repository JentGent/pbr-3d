# PBR-3D
3D engine made with WebGL that uses physically based rendering: Schlick's approximation (fresnel), Trowbridge-Reitz distribution (microfacets), and Schlick-GGX geometry approximation plugged into the Cook-Torrance bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model.
Features normal-oriented hemisphere screen space ambient occlusion (sample locations randomized per pixel) and shadow mapping.
